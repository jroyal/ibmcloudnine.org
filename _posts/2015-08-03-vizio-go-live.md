### Brainstorming

This story starts, like a lot of them do, with Pete asking us to start brainstorming. We were finally reaching the end of our mad sprint to the end and the team was looking forward to a well deserved break. Using pretty much any excuse at this point to not look at vizio, Lisa and I started to brainstorm. It didn't take long until Janek walked by and decided to join in the fun as we made a list of things we might want to do. At the time they all seemed pretty reasonable to our sleep deprived brains.

I mean who doesn't want to take a party barge to cuba? We all thought that was the best idea out of the bunch, but apparently that is "unreasonably expensive". 

Psh managers... 

### Decisions, Decisions, Decisions

Now that we had finally sat down and created a list of things we thought we might want to do, we had to finally narrow it down. The three of us liked party barge the most, but that had a few downsides. 

1. People have to actually show up on time otherwise they get left behind. Which knowing our group, would most likely leave a bunch of sad people on the shore.
1. People would be stuck on a boat in a lake for a few hours. For most people this would probably be fine, but for flexibility reasons this was another strike.
1. There was a fear that we couldn't get a party barge large enough for the entire group.

Long story short, we decided against the party barge. We started debating bowling after that. Highland lanes is a fun place that you can go and spend a few hours hanging out with friends. Why not go there? Well Janek brought up the suggestion that if we were going to bowl we might want to consider going to Main Event. For those of you that don't have a main event, [go checkout their website.](http://www.mainevent.com/) Essentially its a place where you can go and do a bunch of activities. They have bowling, pool, shuffleboard, laser tag, mini golf, rock climbing, and a game room. All in all there is probably something there for everyone.

### Decision made. Time to get $$$.

Making the decision is easy. Getting money to fund whatever we want to do is hard. Although in this particular instance it actually wasn't all that difficult. Since all the sites were doing some form of celebration this event was a lot easier to get by. So within a couple of days we had money, set a date, and placed the order. 

### Disaster strikes

We had originally set the date for our party to be July 17th. I don't know about everyone else but I had been looking forward to that day for a while now. So when we got a call from Brad 3 hours before we were supposed to leave telling us that we were probably going to have to cancel, not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed. I understand why we did it. I don't remember the exact cause, but something had just blown up in vizio (like it had been for the last few weeks) and we had to stay to work on that. I do remember that I sent one gif that day that to me symbolized everything about vizio.

### The day finally arrives

Eventually we were able to reschedule and we were able to finally have our party on July 31st, one month after go live. I was excited! We left promptly at 11:45 and headed straight there. We started off with a nice buffet lunch where we got a bunch of fancy food. Salad, portabella mushroom ravioli, beef, pork, chicken on a stick, scallop potatoes, cornbread, and a desert bar. All in all I was surpised for what I expected to be a more or less mediocre buffet lunch. Unfortunately I didn't think to take any pictures during lunch. 

After lunch a group of us went and started bowling. We had a couple of lanes reserved so we decided to see who was the best. Janek hustled us by throwing gutter balls his first few frames and then strikes and spares the rest of the way.

After Janek creamed us, we decided to use a few of our drink tickets and play some shuffleboard. Side bar; does anyone actually know the rules to shuffleboard? Because we just kinda made it up as we went along. Had fun regardless.

After a beer or two, we headed over to the glow in the dark mini golf course. It was pretty dark in there so picture taking was a little difficult. I don't think most of us kept score because to be honest that course is pretty awful. They make it wheel chair accessible which is fine except that there is a giant spot in each hole where there isn't a wall and your ball will just keep on rolling. Also I think my shirt was throwing off my night vision because it was so bright in the blacklights.

It was pretty dark in there.

After mini golf we wandered around the game room and showed off our competitive spirits playing DDR and air hockey.

A few of us went to the bar.

As the day started to wind down we decided to go play a few relaxing games of pool.

### Closing thoughts

At the end of the day I like to think that the go live party succeeded in what we were hoping to accomplish. We got to spend some time with friends from work, got to know each other a little better, and had some fun. It was a great way to wrap up the last few months of frantic activity that led up to go live. 

Here's to hoping that everyone loves the new Bluemix and Vizio products that made it out the door!
