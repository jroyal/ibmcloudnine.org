### Motivation

The cloud 9 committee has always wanted a place to send people to keep them up to date with what we do. Previously we had tried communities, but we never were very satisfied with how communities worked. It was hidden out of the way at a random URL that no one could actually remember, and its editor was clunky. Probably it's biggest flaw though was that picture management was the worst. Literally the worst. I could go on and on about the things that I didn't like about communities, but I will leave it at that.

### Birth 

So during some free time from vizio we started working on this site. I had some prior experience with Jekyll because of the alchemy dashboard, and my own personal site so I went with that as the backend of this site. All in all I was surprised at how quickly this site took shape. It's not perfect, but it has a good base for us to work with as we decide on what we want in the future. 

### Blog

As you probably saw on the front page, this is primarily a blog to keep up with the events we put on for our team here in Austin. As events come and go, expect some posts about our experience. 

### Roster

We also are going to try and keep an updated roster of who is on the committee so if you have any suggestions on things to improve or events to put on you can let us know. 

### Upcoming Events

If you go to the [calendar page](http://ibmcloudnine.org/calendar/) you can see a calendar of our upcoming events. If you would like something to get put on that, please let us know and we can add it for you. This is pulled automatically from our google calendar so it should always be up to date with information on what we have planned.

### Photo Gallery

We also have plans for a photo gallery so that we can post some pictures from our events. At the moment this is still a work in progress. When we get some more time we will try to make sure that the gallery gets stood up.
